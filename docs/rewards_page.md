##How to get your own rewards page

Rewards pages are free and can be hosted on GitHub for free!

1. If you do not have a GitHub account, make one for free!
2. Click the Fork link on this repository. This creates your own copy of the fork. This will let you edit your own copy with your own custom rewards
3. Edit the files within GitHub based on your own commands. **This is important, if you don't make an edit that page will not show up**
4. Click the settings tab on your forked repository, and make sure that the page is set to the docs/ directory
5. Edit the irc_cfg.py file on your home computer copy of Coreuptedbot to point REWARDS_PAGE back to the page generated by github pages.
6. Restart Coreuptedbot if it is already running
