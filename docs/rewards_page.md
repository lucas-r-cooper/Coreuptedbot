#How to get your own rewards page

Rewards pages are free and can be hosted on GitHub for free!

This is the default starting page which includes instructions on how to get started with creating your own free rewards page.

1. If you do not have a GitHub account, make one for free!
2. Click the Fork link on this repository. This creates your own copy of the fork. This will let you edit your own copy with your own custom rewards
3. Edit the files within GitHub based on your own commands. **This is important, if you don't make an edit that page will not show up**
4. Click the settings tab on your forked repository, and make sure that the page is set to the docs/ directory
5. Edit the irc_cfg.py file on your home computer copy of Coreuptedbot to point REWARDS_PAGE back to the page generated by github pages.
6. Restart Coreuptedbot if it is already running

From below you can see an example of a command in markdown (github styling)

**!myreward:** Put the details of your awesome reward here! Don't forget to put two new lines afterwards. If you only put one it won't space correctly!

**!myreward2:** A fun little reward for my viewers :)
