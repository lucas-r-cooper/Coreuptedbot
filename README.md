# Coreuptedbot: Open Source Revlo Replacement

Coreuptedbot is a simple python program that works with SQLite to create a loyalty bot for Twitch Streamers

### Features:

* Points given out for first time chatters
* Reward Redemption
* Gives points to viewers
* The commands from Revlo that you know and love e.g. "!bonus", "!gamble", etc

## Caution: You are hosting all point values on your computer. Make a backup of the database from time to time.

This will be detailed when this actually has a database

# Getting Started (WIP)

Download this repo.

Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) running and installed.
