# To get started with announcements, make a copy of this file as "announcements.txt"
# If you do not make announcements.txt or it is empty, the bot will make no announcements
# For each chat announcement, put the full announcement on its own line
# Announcements will start from the top, continue to the bottom, then start at the top again
# Timing for announcements can be set in irc_cfg.py. The default is once per 5 minutes
# Lines starting with # will be ignored, like this one
# Below are some starter announcements
